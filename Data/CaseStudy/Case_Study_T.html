<!--Add: Text Paragraph with Annotation. 

We have designed annotations, so that they are responsive to where you are on the case study. These appear on the right column next to the footnote. To add a footnote, insert the following line of code. Please change numbers in order. Everytime, you add a footnote, you will be required to go to the footnote section of the code, to add in the text and link.

To add a footnote, insert: <div class="footnote footnote-1">1</div> 
Starting from #1, change as you proceed-->

<!--Add: Text Paragraph with Video. 
To add a Video, either upload from Vimeo or YouTube
Insert this code:
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
then include the iframe afterwards.
Go to the Video and find the sharing options. Select 'embed.' it will return a long pirece of code starting with iframe. add this after the div class (see the example below)

<!--Add: Text with Interactive. 
As part of the project, you might design an interactive website or use another site's tools to make an interactive component. If you would like to include that in the case study, the easiest way might be linking that to an image. We suggest this as oppose to integrating them into your case study. Interactives might be heavier files and be difficult to load, instantly. Below, there are 3 examples.

1. Linking Interactive to html
 
<a href="mymap/index.html"><img src="img/skyline.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></a>

2. Embedding Interactive (This is ok if it's a couple of layers)
This example was made with plotly
<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~linguanne/12.embed"></iframe>


3. Embedding an entire website (As case study is responsive, test ! test !)

<iframe width='100%' height='500px' frameBorder='0' src= "http://c4sr.columbia.edu/conflict-urbanism-aleppo/index.html" name="iframe_x"></iframe> 
<p><a href="http://c4sr.columbia.edu/conflict-urbanism-aleppo/index.html" target="iframe_x">Aleppo Site</a></p>

<!--Add: Text with Interactive Map. 
You can bring any project from Carto using the Embed (iFrame) method Just copy and paste the code from the Publish >> Embed option. 
Or from Mapbox editor, using the iframe method (covered in tutorial 7)

Following is the code that you copy/paste from CArto: 
<iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://michellejm.carto.com/viz/f07c01f8-85b7-11e6-96f9-0e05a8b3e3d7/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


Note: You can bring in any project, with the above code as long as you have your mapbox API key and map id
