This tutorial covers the very basics of data visualization and digital storytelling, covering visualization types, features to consider and important design considerations. The purpose of this tutorial is to help you create informative, appealing visuals to accompany your final project. 

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Determine which type of visualization will best represent your data
2. Identify features of a "good" visualization
3. Decide when to use raw data and when to transform it


## Part I - Data and Statistics

The most important part of any visualization is the data. Data can refer to "big data", just a few data points, or anything in between (i.e., census data). Sometimes the raw data is not best to illustrate the story you want to tell. In those cases you want to transform it. 

Basic Data transformations
1. Mean, Median, Mode
  1. Mean - this is the average you are used to (add all the numbers and divide by the total)
  2. Median - the number in the middle, this helps account for outliers
  3. Mode - the number that occurs the most often
2. Real, Ranked, Percentage (2011-2015 American Community Survey)
  1. Real numbers are the raw data so there were X Vietnamese speakers reported in the census in 2011-2015 for each county
  Bronx: 2871
  Brooklyn: 3272
  Manhattan: 1365
  Queens: 2712
  Staten Island: 507
  Total: 10729
  
  2. Ranked: 
  27th most common language out of 40 languages
  This is in the 33rd percentile. So, among languages spoken at home, 67% of languages are more common than Vietnamese.
  
  3. Percentages
    1. Percent of Vietnamese speakers in each borough:
    Bronx: 30%
    Brooklyn: 29%
    Manhattan: 13%
    Queens: 25%
    Staten Island: 4%
    
    2. Percentage of each borough that speaks Vietnamese:
    Bronx: 0.22%
    Brooklyn: 0.14%
    Manhattan: 0.09%
    Queens: 0.13%
    Staten Island: 0.11%
    New York City: 0.14%
    
 That's fine, but often change tells a more compelling story. 

1. Let's look at 2006-2010 ACS data. Taking the middle year, here, we will treat this as 2008, and the 2011-2015 as 2013.
2. From 2008-2013, there are 2 more Vietnamese speakers living in NYC, though 300 of them moved from the Bronx to Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
3. Let's look at a group of speakers who have seen more change in that time: 
  1. Speakers of African Languages: 35% growth
  2. Speakers of Arabic and Armenia both saw 32% growth. That's a change of 1062 people for Armenian and 13,871 for Arabic. 
  3. This shows a huge change in people for
